Known Bugs
----------
- graphs are not displayed on smart phones;

- If the first label is long, it can be truncated

   In "sample.html", if you put : 
   
    var mydata1 = {   
	    labels : ["January this is a very long label","February","March","April","May","June","July"],
	    
	    => "January this is a very long label" will be truncated (outside of the graph area)
